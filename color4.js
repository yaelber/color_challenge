// Challenge problem!
// on clicking a color for Color 1 and a color for Color 2,
// print the name of the color that results from the color mix

// using the same assumptions from our last exercise with colors. That is:
// -- red + yellow = orange, red + blue = purple, and blue + yellow = green
// -- any secondary color blended with a primary color that it was made of, returns the secondary color
// -- any secondary color blended with a color other than a primary color it was made of, returns brown
//     (e.g., purple + yellow = brown, orange + purple = brown, green + red = brown)
// -- brown mixed with any other color is still brown

// Challenge: make the result div colored by the resulting blended color
// and have it update accordingly whenever color 1 or color 2 is changed.
